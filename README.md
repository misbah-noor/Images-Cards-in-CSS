# Responsive Cards in CSS
Here! I have discussed flexbox properties that how to create a responsive cards by using those properties.Hope so it might be helpful ðŸš€ðŸ‘‡.

1. display: The display property is set to flex to enable Flexbox layout on the container element. This property can also be set to inline-flex to create an inline-level flex container.

2. flex-direction: This property determines the direction in which flex items are placed in the flex container. It can be set to row, row-reverse, column, or column-reverse.

3. flex-wrap: Controls whether flex items are forced onto a single line or can wrap onto multiple lines within the flex container. It can be set to nowrap, wrap, or wrap-reverse.

4. justify-content: Specifies how flex items are aligned along the main axis of the flex container. Values include flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, and space-around.

5. align-items: Defines how flex items are aligned along the cross axis of the flex container. Values include stretch, flex-start, flex-end, center, and baseline.

6. align-content: Applies to multi-line flex containers and determines how lines are aligned in the cross axis. Values include flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around, and stretch.

7. flex-grow: Specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the other items in the container. It takes a unitless value representing the proportionate amount of space to distribute among flex items.

8. flex-shrink: Specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the other items in the container when there isn't enough space. It takes a unitless value representing the relative shrink factor.

9. flex-basis: Sets the initial main size of a flex item before distributing extra space or shrinking. It can be set to a length or keyword like auto.

10. flex: A shorthand property that combines flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis properties in one declaration.
